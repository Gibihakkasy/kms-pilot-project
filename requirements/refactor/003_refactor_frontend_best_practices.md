# Refactor Step 3: Frontend Best Practice Separation

## Goal
Ensure the frontend follows best practices by enforcing clear separation of concerns, centralizing API logic, and standardizing error/loading handling. Improve maintainability and clarity for future development.

---

## Sub-Tasks

1. **Enforce separation of concerns:**
   - Keep all API logic in `frontend/lib/api.ts`.
   - Use hooks (`use-chat`, `use-documents`) only for state management and API calls.
   - Ensure UI components are presentational and stateless.
2. **Standardize error and loading handling:**
   - Use consistent patterns for error, loading, and progress states across hooks and components.
3. **Document the frontend architecture:**
   - Add or update a `README.md` in `frontend/` to describe the main hooks, API client, and component structure.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All API logic is centralized in the API client.
- Hooks are only used for state management and API calls.
- UI components are presentational and stateless.
- Error and loading handling is consistent across the frontend.
- Frontend architecture is documented for contributors.
