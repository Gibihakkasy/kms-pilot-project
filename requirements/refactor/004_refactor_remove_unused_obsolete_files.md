# Refactor Step 4: Remove Unused/Obsolete Files

## Goal
Audit the entire repository for unused, obsolete, or trash files and remove them to ensure a clean, professional, and minimal project structure.

---

## Sub-Tasks

1. **Identify unused, obsolete, or trash files:**
   - Files like `config.py`, `setup.py`, `.DS_Store`, backup files, editor temp files, and any other files not required for running, developing, or maintaining the project.
2. **Remove or archive unnecessary files:**
   - Delete files that are not needed.
   - Archive or document any files intentionally kept for legacy/reference reasons.
3. **Update `.gitignore` as needed:**
   - Ensure patterns for editor temp files, OS metadata files, and other trash are included.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All unused, obsolete, or trash files are removed from the repository.
- Only files required for running, developing, or maintaining the project remain.
- `.gitignore` is up-to-date to prevent future clutter.
