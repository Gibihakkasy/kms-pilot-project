# Refactor Step 5: Clean Up Unused/Test/Trash Code

## Goal
Audit all code for unused, test, or trash code and lines, and remove them to ensure all modules are clean, readable, and maintainable.

---

## Sub-Tasks

1. **Identify unused, test, or trash code:**
   - Commented-out code, dead code (unused functions, classes, variables), leftover debug prints, TODOs, and temporary hacks.
   - Redundant or obsolete test code, manual test blocks, or test files not covered by proper automated tests.
   - Unused imports and variables.
2. **Remove or refactor unnecessary code:**
   - Delete or refactor code that is not needed.
   - Ensure all modules are clean and maintainable.
3. **Run a linter/static analysis:**
   - Use tools to help catch unused imports, variables, and other code hygiene issues.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All unused, test, or trash code is removed from the codebase.
- No commented-out, dead, or debug code remains.
- All modules are clean, readable, and maintainable.
- Linter/static analysis reports minimal or no issues related to unused code.
